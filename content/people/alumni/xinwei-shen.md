I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. I was a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich working with Peter Bühlmann and Nicolai Meinshausen. Previously, I obtained my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at HKUST in 2022, supervised by Tong Zhang. I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree at Fudan University in 2018.

My research interests lie at the interface of statistics and machine learning. My current research focuses on distributional learning, causality, robustness, as well as climate applications.
